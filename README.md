NUnitLite
=========

This is a version of NUnitLite that works with Windows Phone 8.

A test runner user control for Windows 8 is provided is well. Usage can be inferred from the nunitlite.tests-wp8 project.

I have removed all of the SilverLight libraries from the solution because I don't want to install all those SDKs. If you need that functionality, the original project is your best bet.

You can find the original code at https://launchpad.net/nunitlite
